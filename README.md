Cpp_Primer_5th_Solutions

This repository contains solutions for some of the exercises in the book C++ Primer 5th Edition by Lippman, Lajoie and Moo.

I'm writing and testing most of the code in MS Visual Studio 2013. 
The code is based on my own interpretation of the exercises, so use it at your own risk.

Any corrections or recommendations are welcome.

Thanks,

Sergio PL
